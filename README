Conference Rooms
----------------

Conference Rooms is not a module, but is a web-based
(CGI) application. How you install it is going
to depend on what HTTP server you are running,
where you want the thing to live, and what 
OS you are running on.

So, rather than go through all that in gory
details, I would encourage you to look at the 
information provided on the web site at
http://www.rcbowen.com/products/conference/ where
you will find general information, and an 
installation document.

In particular, please look at the system 
requirements portion, which will tell you what
perl modules you will need to install before
the thing will work.
