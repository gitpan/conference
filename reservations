14~~Check this out~~0~~4~~MS~~MS~~2~~This room was entered for originally for the Engineering Conference room then EDITED to the Boardroom causing a conflict.  There is not checking to prevent this as originally done when there is the initial reservation made. ~~2441653
15~~Delete me~~6~~9~~MS~~MS~~2~~Delete this file and look what's underneath me.  You've got a bug in your editing feature.  It doesn't check against other reservations going on at the same room/time.  This could cause you problems and $$$ (because people may not want to buy your $300 package).~~2441653
