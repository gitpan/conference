Conference Rooms
----------------

Conference Rooms is not a module, but is a web-based
(CGI) application. How you install it is going
to depend on what HTTP server you are running,
where you want the thing to live, and what 
OS you are running on.

There are more complete instructions in the readme.html
and install.html files included with this distribution.
They are in HTML format because I simply skeetched them
from my web site. For more complete, and perhaps more
up-to-date information, you may wish to look there,
at http://www.rcbowen.com/products/conference/ .

"Conference Rooms" does not have any problem handling 
dates occurring after January 1, 2000, but it may run
into some problems after 2038. I expect to resolve that
issue before then.

See also the changes file.

DESCRIPTION

Conference Rooms is a CGI application that allows scheduling
of conference rooms, or other resources, from your web 
browser. One day I got sick of walking to the receptionist's
desk to schedule a conference room, so I wrote this, and 
got rid of her book.

DEPENDENCIES

This code uses the Time::* modules distributed under the
name "Time-modules". This package contains JulianDate, 
DateParse, CTime, and a variety of others, and is available
from CPAN in modules/by-module/Time/

You also should have a web server, and access to your CGI
directory. See install.html for installation instructions.
