Conference Rooms
----------------

Conference Rooms is not a module, but is a web-based
(CGI) application. How you install it is going
to depend on what HTTP server you are running,
where you want the thing to live, and what 
OS you are running on.

There are more complete instructions in the readme.html
and install.html files included with this distribution.
They are in HTML format because I simply skeetched them
from my web site. For more complete, and perhaps more
up-to-date information, you may wish to look there,
at http://www.rcbowen.com/products/conference/ .

"Conference Rooms" does not have any problem handling 
dates occurring after January 1, 2000, but it may run
into some problems after 2038. I expect to resolve that
issue before then.
