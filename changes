Version 3.11 - Nov 30, 1998
Minor bug fix. Conflicts were not being caught when
editing reservations.

Version 3.10 Nov 28, 1998
Split "user" and "admin" functions so that people.
can restrict who has access to the add, edit, and
delete functions.
Added "Jump to date" feature.
Stored user's Name and Email address in a cookie, 
so that they do not have to be re-entered each time 
the user adds a reservation. This is a configurable
option in the Conference.pm file.
Added file locking to prevent some of the file
corruption problems that busy sites were seeing.
Some code cleanup.

Version 3.01 and 3.02
Minor bug fixes
