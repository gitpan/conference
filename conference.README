This is a script that will allow you to reserve conference rooms on your
intranet.  You can put in a list of conference rooms, and a list of
valid times, and the script will (should) do the rest.  I wrote this
yesterday afternoon, so if it does not work properly, expect updates
for a little while.

Let me know if you use this,
